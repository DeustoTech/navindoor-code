   <originalCode>%% |publishreadme.m|: Publish Matlab README file to markdown and html
% Author: Kelly Kearney
%
% This repository includes the code for the |publishreadme.m| Matlab
% function, along with all dependent functions required to run it.  
%
% This function is designed to publish a README.m documentation and
% examples script to both HTML and GitHub-flavored markdown, making it
% easier to use a single file for both GitHub and MatlabCentral File
% Exchange documentation.    
%
%% Getting started
%
% *Prerequisites*
%
% This function requires Matlab R14 or later.
%
% *Downloading and installation*
%
% This code can be downloaded from &lt;https://github.com/kakearney/publishreadme-pkg/ Github&gt;
%
% *Matlab Search Path*
%
% The following folders need to be added to your Matlab Search path (via
% |addpath|, |pathtool|, etc.):
%
%   publishreadme-pkg/publishreadme

%% Syntax
%
%  publishreadme(folder, xmlflag)
%
% Input variables:
%
% * |folder|: path to folder where README.m file is located
% * |xmlflag|: logical scalar, indicates whether to create XML file (true) or not (false)

%% Examples
%
% This file is itself an example of how this function can be used.  The
% README.m file was used to write documentation for this code, then
% converted to both HTML and GitHub-flavored markdown via the
% |publishreadme| function.
%
% Just for demonstration purposes, here is an example with some
% syntax-highlighted code, along with the screen printout and plot
% resulting from it:

x = 1:10;
y = x.^2

plot(x,y);

%% Contributions
%
% Community contributions to this package are welcome!
% 
% To report bugs, please submit
% &lt;https://github.com/kakearney/example-pkg/issues an issue&gt; on GitHub and
% include:  
% 
% * your operating system
% * your version of Matlab and all relevant toolboxes (type |ver| at the Matlab command line to get this info)  
% * code/data to reproduce the error or buggy behavior, and the full text of any error messages received 
% 
% Please also feel free to submit enhancement requests, or to send pull
% requests (via GitHub) for bug fixes or new features. 
% 
% I do monitor the MatlabCentral FileExchange entry for any issues raised
% in the comments, but would prefer to track issues on GitHub.
